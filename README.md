currently implemented challenges:

1. custom max health configuration
2. onlyhotbar
3. 30 seconds = random effect
4. chunk decay (chunk gets deleted when left)
5. damage dealt = damage taken (player receives exactly the amount of damage they deal)
6. no item pickup
7. force proximity (players need to be within 100 blocks of each other) (not fully implemented yet)
